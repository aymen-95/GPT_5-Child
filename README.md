# GPT\_5 Child 👶🤖

> An open-source project to build a **programmatic child** that continuously learns from interactions and experiments inside a system environment, inspired by how human children develop intelligence.

---

## ✨ Concept

Just like a human child is born with innate foundations (senses, reflexes, curiosity) and then learns through experience — **GPT\_5 Child** is born with a linguistic base (Base LLM) but grows and develops itself through:

* **Writing** and experimenting instead of sensory input.
* **Tools** (Sandbox, DB, Web, API calls).
* **Short-term and long-term memory** (STM/LTM).
* **Continual learning** via Adapters (LoRA) and Replay.
* **Curiosity and reward mechanisms** to evaluate experiences and consolidate useful ones.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

* **Orchestrator**: The brain that directs interactions.
* **Memory Manager**: STM + LTM using a Vector DB.
* **Tool Router**: Connects to external tools.
* **Base LLM + Adapters**: The core brain with acquired skills.
* **Trainer/Updater**: Continuously updates adapters.
* **Evaluator/Reward Model**: Judges quality and feedback.
